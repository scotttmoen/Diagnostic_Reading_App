**Leishmaniasis PCR Privacy Policy**
I endevoured to make this application as simple as possible so that it will work in perpetuity, as much as a mobile application can. To this end, there isn't any off-line component. No data is exported with this app. When you take a photograph, it is saved to the local directory on the mobile device so that you can perform a sanity check after you get the application's results. Again, no data is exported from the phone.
